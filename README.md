# Tic-tac-toe AI
A simple game written in Python3 and PyGame to teach me the game theory MinMax algorithm.

## The Roadmap
- [x] Make tiles change on click
- [x] Make an algorithm to detect win situation
- [x] Make an algorithm to detect draw situation
- [x] Make visualisation (draw black lines over the winning line)
- [ ] Make an algorithm to check and count all possible states the game can end in
- [ ] Write the MinMax algorithm
- [ ] Add Alfa/Beta prunning to further speed up the MM algorithm
