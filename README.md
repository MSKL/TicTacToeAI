# TicTacToeAI
A simple game written in Python3 and PyGame to teach me the game theory MinMax algorithm.

## The Roadmap
- [x] Make tiles change on click (3x3)
- [x] Expand the map to be any size
- [x] Make algorithm detect win situation
- [ ] Make algorithm detect draw situation
- [x] Make visualisation (draw black lines over the winning line)
- [ ] Simple algorithm to check all possible states that can happen
- [ ] Apply MinMax
- [ ] Add alfa/beta branching
